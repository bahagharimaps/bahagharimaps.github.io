Our next map project is Mt. Masaraga, a 1,328 extinct stratovolcano located right beside the more famous Mayon volcano, and is the upcoming venue for the next [MFPI](https://www.mfpi.org) Midyear Congress being held later this month. The map is a work in progress as there is limited data available in OpenStreetMap. We're hoping to get updated trail data and, as Masaraga is a declared watershed forest reserve, updated PA boundary. We'll update the map as soon as we get the data.
