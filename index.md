# What's New?

### 2022 December 19

New Map Mondays! So we're back to mapping trails after a brief sojourn presenting our work in this year's [Pista ng Mapa](https://www.facebook.com/PistaNgMapaPH/). Our next map project is Mt. Dialanese, a mountain found in the Province of Quirino. This is an execellent example of working with quality trail data where in trail segments are nicely tagged, hiking POIs are well marked and named. All this quality trail mapping work was done by [Kiyaw Mountaineers](https://www.facebook.com/kiyawmountaineers/) and [Schadow1 Expeditions](https://www.s1expeditions.com/) -- we just did the map layout :D following the OSM-recommended trail rendering.

Our next map project is Mt. Masaraga, a 1,328 extinct stratovolcano located right beside the more famous Mayon volcano, and is the upcoming venue for the next [MFPI](https://www.mfpi.org) Midyear Congress being held later this month. The map is a work in progress as there is limited data available in OpenStreetMap. We're hoping to get updated trail data and, as Masaraga is a declared watershed forest reserve, updated PA boundary. We'll update the map as soon as we get the data.
